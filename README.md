# Features
D&D Buddy contains the following features:

1. User Registration and Login
    1. User will initially arrive at our login page, where they can gain entry to our character sheet by entering their email and password. 
    2. If the user is new to our site they will need to register first and the button to register is clearly displayed on the login page.

2. Creating Character
    1. User can follow our modal questionnaire to generate character sheet.
    2. User can exit questionnaire and select the character's name, gender, race and class without aid.
    3. User can elect a random name, gender, race and class without going through questionnaire.

3. Editing Character
    1. At anypoint the user can change their character by double clicking the element of their character they would like to edit.
    2. User can add or subtract character hitpoints determined by campaign play.

4. Saving Character
    1. After creating or editing their character the user has the option to save their character to our database, which will allow them to use the same character for multiple Dungeon and Dragons sessions and campaigns.
    2. Additionally, generating a new character and not saving will allow the user to play a one off campaign but return to their main character later.

3. Charcter Image, Stats, Skills and Weapons
    1. Character's image, stats, skills and weapons will be dynamically generated based on their characters gender, race and class.
    2. If user edits their character, intuitively the application will regenerate the appropriate image, stats, skills and weapons.

4. Dice Roll
    1. User can click on any one of six dice images, all which are used during Dungeons and Dragons campaign play, to generate a random roll.
    2. Each click will produce a dice rolling sound for an enhanced user experience.

5. Help Guides
    1. User has access to multiple help guides through out the application.
    2. Help guides have been placed strategically, where the user is likely to look for them. On mobile screens many of the help guides have been aggregated and can be found by clicking on User Guide in the top left corner.
    3. Guides will provide game definitions to assist beginners with campaign play as well as guides to how the site functions which all users may find beneficial to help them navigate our site.
